# Sarvam AI - Odia ↔ English Translator

This project was built as part of the Microsoft Student Ambassador **Startup Advocate Path**. It aims to support the local Odia-speaking community by providing a simple, web-based translation tool using **Sarvam AI's API**.

## 🌐 Project Overview

The translator allows users to:
- Translate from **Odia to English**
- Translate from **English to Odia**

It is designed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks — to ensure simplicity and accessibility.

> ⚠️ Note: The Sarvam API currently has some limitations. We focused on the frontend and flow for now, and aim to improve the integration as the API becomes more stable.

## 💡 Purpose

Many members of the Odia community face language barriers when accessing global content or tech platforms. This project helps bridge that gap with a simple interface anyone can use.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Sarvam AI API (for translation)

## 🤝 Contribution

- I developed this project solo for the Startup Advocate path.
- My main focus was translation for social/community upliftment using a local language.
- Current focus was on frontend + partial backend; enhancements will follow once API is stable.
